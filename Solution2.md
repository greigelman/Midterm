a.) Two static analysis tools are FindBugs and Cppcheck. Findbugs is a tool that is used to detect bugs using bytecode. A pro is that it can be used in Java programs. A con is that it cannot be used in anything that does not use bytecode. Cppcheck is a tool that is used to detect bugs using source code. A pro is that it will work in C/C++ programs. A con is that it cannot be used in any program that does not use source code. Two dynamic analysis tools are valgrind and discover.
